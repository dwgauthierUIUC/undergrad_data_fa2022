# undergrad_data_fa2022

This contains all of the notebooks for Sarika, Haichao, and Zaria

For everyone,
  We have until Thursday to get this data compiled. I will be working on all of it myself alongside you, so if you need help just text me and we will figure it out

For Sarika, 
  Copy my notebook into your own Jupyter so the original that I made can stay here and then add your own stuff to your copy
  Then add your copy to this repository
  Plot the TSC vs WT data (color TSC blue to make Ben happy) like I have done with the fmr1 data
  
For Haichao,
  Use the ABR processor to process your files in batches based on frequency (BBN, 4khz, etc)
  You can plot those however you like (R, excel, etc)
  I'll be doing a jupyter notebook and anlalyze whatever data you want to extract from the ABRs just to double check you
  
For Zaria,
  Same as Haichao, but we have to factor in the Hearing Loss so that's an extra variable. And then you will need to make some charts similar to Sarika's
  Like with the other datasets, I will be working on these as well so I can double check you and help you as you need it up to Thursday

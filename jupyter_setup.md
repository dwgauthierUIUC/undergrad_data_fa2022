# Jupyter Instructions

Installation
(There is a web based Jupyter Notebook called JupyterLite that should work the same if you don't want to install anything, but I use the installed version so there may some issues there, but haven't tried it yet)

1. search 'anaconda download' on internet or just go here https://www.anaconda.com/ and click the big download button
2. Run the installer with the default options
3. Open Anaconda Navigator (if you can't find it, you can install it by opening anaconda terminal and typing 'conda install anaconda-navigator'
4. Once opened click on Jupyter Notebook and that should work

Setting Up Jupyter

1. The file layout is like a normal computer. Make yourself a folder for your project
2. Add your csv files (from either GitHub or Box if they are there too) to your project folder
3. Create a jupyter notebook in the same project folder as all of the csv files you uploaded

Using Jupyter

1. Once the notebook is open you can use the code I posted to get started
2. This is all Python coding for data analysis so if you aren't comfortable with it just text me and I'll help however I can
3. If you really can't figure it out, and still want to play with the data on your own you can use whatever you are familiar with (Excel,R,etc.)
4. Essentially you want to break your code up so that a cell in this notebook will output something useful because you get one output per cell (i.e. one plot, one table, etc.)
5. In the beginning you will want to copy the imports that I use as these will allow you to make fancy graphs
6. The code for the data extraction should be consistent for each data set so just copy what I do
7. For the plots, the main structure is the same, but you will have to change the names and colors and other properties as you need, which should be straightforward enough
8. Once you have your data analyzed, or just want me to check it over, you can upload it to the ghithub or to Box (i think that would work fine too)
